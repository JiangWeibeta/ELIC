# ELIC
Unofficial Implementation of CVPR22 papar "ELIC: Efficient Learned Image Compression with Unevenly Grouped Space-Channel Contextual Adaptive Coding".

My implementation is based on CompressAI.

Code will be available soon :)

I trained a model model optimized for MSE. $\lambda$ is set to $0.08$. The performance of the ELIC reproduced by me have the same rate-distortion with the official ELIC on Kodak and better performance than official ELIC on CLIC 2021 Test dataset.
